When it comes to observational studies, macro studies (define) invite observations, connections, or even conclusions (dare we go this far), at any speeds of analysis used 

Taking summary metrics on a topic,  we can break them down by commonly defined characteristics (geography, demography, etc). Is it clear when are these breakdowns useful, and when are they too convenient ? 

Implications of racism are counterproductive when used too broadly.  It certainly can be one of multiple factors in some cases - but macro approaches to analysis can  

**forwards/micro analysis**
- Might not get us to the end target, but can get us to an intermediate step (which can have an effect on the end target we directionally agree on - even if uncertain magnitude)
- (unsure about this) when the steps forward are less defined, theyâ€™re more intentionally chosen

(Time ? when factors earlier in timeline affect)
