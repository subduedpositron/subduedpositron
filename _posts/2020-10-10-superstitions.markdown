*actions done in preparation for an upcoming moment, that don’t materially affect the moment*
<!-- Tags: personal -->

When I was playing sports, I’d have some superstitions. 
Some would be in-game - touching my hand to my body/uniform or saying a phrase (random, not even for priming a mental mindset), some actions before certain situations, other actions in different situations. I couldn’t tell you why at the time I felt I had to do these. I later read an explanation that made me understand it a little more.
Superstitions help you remove doubt. Because you do these things, even if they don’t affect the situation at all - they put you in a more predictable, and therefore more confident mindset. However, being pre-occupied with completing these routines is distracting to some extent.
I now know why i had these superstitious actions- but the understanding now i have of superstitions makes me less likely to do them/feel the need to.

Regarding uniform numbers - looking back, I wonder about playing wearing the number 13.  Embracing this supposedly unlucky number and then succeeding with it. 

I try to separate superstitions from routines, even though there’s some overlap. Routines are done to actually get ready. Ex. a same meal (pre - game (or other situation) , because it has a predictable effect on your body. So there’s value in following routines.
So I devalue superstitions more now, ironically by understanding them better.
