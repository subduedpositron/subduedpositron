To be a favorite or an underdog
I  am trying to put myself in situations of my life where I feel like the underdog in some parts, and a favorite in others. 

Being (or being perceived as) a favorite means having high expectations to live up to. Getting other’s best shots. It also gets you used to winning, and even when falling behind early, a confidence to recover.

Being the underdog can help develop a nothing to lose mindset, and trying riskier/unconventional strategies. 

Having both allows contrasting these different mindsets, instead of getting used to one mentality and thinking that’s my reality.  This is also different from systems like ELO-matching, which intends to match you with similar ability levels
