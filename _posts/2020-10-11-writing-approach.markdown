#### My anticipated writing focuses/approach for each post
- [**Logic Rationale: Principles** over facts/laws](https://subduedpositron.github.io/subduedpositron/jekyll/update/2020/10/08/principles.html)
    - Aim to capture the **degree of uncertainty** of any claims within a post

- **Tone:  neutral/optimistic.** Prefer **realistic** over idealistic, but can have both aspects
- **Scope: Breadth** of topics instead of depth on particular topics 
    - Can see after the fact if recurring themes emerge
- **Time relevance: everlasting** content instead of timely/ephemeral
- **Frequency**:
    - a batch of new post(s) every 1 or 2 months
    - previous posts will be edited anytime for clarity, conciseness, refining of the topic’s objective, etc 
- **Verbosity**: Prefer **brevity with possible under-explanation** instead of the opposite
- **Punctuation Style (/ {} ?)**: use punctuation for intentional ambiguity, and separating sections
    - / means and/or . will also use {} ex. for {many choices / choices with multiple words,etc}
    - (?) means i want to find a more precise word for what i’m trying to convey, and the current word captures the general idea, but may be imprecise

#### not publicly accessible topics/posts
- **In earlier stage**: topics at an earlier stage, to be possibly posted to the unrestricted site later.
    - could still be figuring out the objective of the post
    - or some claims need verification/ensuring they aren’t logically flawed, and I want to eliminate/minimize inexact claims

- **with negative vibes**. ex. about crime media, climate change. Ideas i still want to explore (and **aiming to have a {constructive/minimally ranty} approach**), but don’t want bring more content related to these topics into the same easily accessible sphere as the public posts- there’s plenty of external content on these topics. (And this barrier makes it a more intentional decision with friction to view this, instead of happening upon it).


I'm restricting access to the {underdeveloped/unverified/not logically sound/negative} posts via a phrase: you (will soon be able to) enter it here. It’s “{word}404”, where word is an 8 letter word.
