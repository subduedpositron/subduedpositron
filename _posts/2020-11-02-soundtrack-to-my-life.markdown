I recently re-made this playlist, as i tend to do every few years.

The approach i take to making it:
- Each selected song evokes a memory of a specific moment in time that I can envision
- I always re-make it from scratch to start. Later, i can look back at past versions of this playlist to see if i missed any that should be put in there (some may stay fallen out).
- This means I order it chronologically, almost exactly.  Occasionally a couple of songs are at a close point in time, so they might not have a strict ordering between them 


Characteristics fluctuate:
- Some songs correspond to meaningful moments - Others relatively inconseqeuential.
- Some are a single moment. Others are a recurring moment in my schedule, during a specific phase.
- Some songs also indicate my mood or mindset.
    - This can be either constant , or mark a change/turning point
- Some songs I know at the time are a memorable moment, others only looking back
- It's nice to see the songs with these varying charectistics next to each other, related only chronologically
