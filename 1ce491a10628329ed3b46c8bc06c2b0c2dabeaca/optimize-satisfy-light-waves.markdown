Whether to optimize for excellence,  or doing well enough - satisfactorily is a common internal debate.  
Generally I”ll aim to optimize for selfish reasons, while doing so in a satisiable way for my desired level of societal benefit.  
but there can be a recurring question of : am I going in the right direction ?

With uncertainty on which path to take: one idea that has given me comfort in not having to be fully optimal is: viewing in from a societal lens; 
it’s best if not everyone follows the same path; but rather individuals take (slightly + very) different directions

Even as I choose a direction, I might be finding the cadence for it: high-output, bursty cadences or gradual progress (add link).

The variance in direction reminds me of the astonishing properties of that light, in acting as both a particle and a wave.   
Any individual particle will take a unique path; the aggregate of these directions is the light wave that gives it the (power) we experience in our lives. 
Light waves also travels in different wavelengths; with blue having a higher frequency/energy than red.
