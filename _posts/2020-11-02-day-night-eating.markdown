My eating habits are overall neither terrible nor exemplary - some healthy meals, some not. Throughout my life, I’ve exercised frequently enough to consistently have an athletic level and body composition I’m happy with. But in terms of longer-term health factors, there’s always room to improve. 
I want to: 
- meaningfully improve my nutrition
- without reducing my general enjoyment of food
- without using much more willpower throughout the day.  
- not caring about total # of calories


Saturated fat is the component I want to most reduce. Dietary cholesterol and sodium are relatively close for second place. Dietary cholesterol is [roughly half as important as saturated fat](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/cholesterol-food#1). Sodium can be counteracted with potassium or water.

One approach that doesn’t work for me to consistently hit these goals, is the “Eat breakfast like a king and dinner like a pauper” approach.  I definitely enjoy large breakfasts to start the day, which may also benefit metabolism. But after eating a healthy/regular-portioned dinner, i’ll sometimes feel hungry later and snack away the benefits afterwards. For that specific day, it seems worth it; as it’s easier for me to go to sleep when not hungry. Also due to willpower depletion as the day elapses, I'm more likely to have unplanned snacks at night for enjoyment over health.

*I’m arriving at an approach for most days - eating well throughout the morning/afternoon, and eating for enjoyment in the evening.*
- a systemic change over a motivational change is easier to both sustain and build on.
    - reduces decision making of whether each meal should be healthy or not
    - starting off on the healthy side makes me feel ahead healthwise throughout the day - and having a meal to look forward to

- short-term (the current day) or mid-term stress with a set end (ex. less than a week) is the largest factor that makes me stray from this 
    - almost always glad I choose enjoyable eating during stressful times, as its worth it
    - so can aim when possible to reduce stressful situations that have this effect, but i'm glad to give in when they do happen without regrets 

- As I know my general willpower is more depleted at night, having the relatively unhealthier meal at that time anyways makes it a more realistic instead of idealistic goal - and also a meal i can fully enjoy
