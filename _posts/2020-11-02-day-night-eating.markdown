My eating habits are overall neither terrible nor exemplary - with some meals being healthy, and others not. Throughout my life, I’ve exercised to consistently have an athletic level and body composition I’m happy with. But in terms of longer-term health factors, there’s always room to improve. 
I want to: 
- meaningfully improve my nutrition (primarily cutting down on saturated fat and secondarily sodium/dietary cholesterol)
- without reducing my general enjoyment of food
- without using much more willpower throughout the day.  
- not caring about total # of calories

Saturated/trans fat seems to be inarguably the component to most reduce. Cholesterol and sodium are relatively close for second place. Dietary cholesterol is [roughly half as important as saturated fat](https://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/cholesterol-food#1). The effects of sodium can be counteracted with potassium.

One approach that doesn’t work for me to consistently hit these goals, is the “Eat breakfast like a king and dinner like a pauper” approach.  I definitely enjoy large breakfasts to start the day, which may also benefit metabolism. But after eating a healthy/regular-portioned dinner, i’ll sometimes feel hungry later and snack away the benefits afterwards. For that specific day, it seems worth it; as it’s easier for me to go to sleep when not hungry. And due to willpower depletion as the day elapses, I'm more likely to snack at night for enjoyment over health.

Therefore, I’m arriving at an approach of eating well throughout the day, and eating for enjoyment in the evening.
- a systemic change over a motivational change is easier to both sustain and build on.
- starting off on the healthy side makes me feel ahead healthwise throughout the day - and having a meal to look forward to, vs having to stay disciplined.
- As I know my general willpower is more depleted at night, having the relatively unhealthier meal at that time anyways makes it a more realistic instead of idealistic goal - and also a meal i can fully enjoy
