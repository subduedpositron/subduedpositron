There’s seemingly a great appeal of using facts, using the objective instead of the subjective.

However subjective opinions are at least presented as such : clearly leave room for disagreement. And there’s sometimes(often?) a hidden deceit where things are presented as indisputable facts but (either intentionally or unintentionally)
- Might not tell the whole story
- Be selected/cherry-picked from a bunch of candidates
- Have a flawed process 
- Are stated too precisely for the actual confidence interval
 
For these reasons, when coming across the phrase “A study shows …” … an initial reaction is to not believe its claims, unless convinced otherwise. Similarly, many statistics - especially from news/sources which can have underlying motivations - are presented as factual/more context-independent than they perhaps truly are.

A funny phenomenon is the claiming of some eponymous “Laws”. Like [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) (more examples), it’s clearly understood that these (esp. non-scientific ones) are adages/rules of thumbs, and perhaps some are stated tongue-in-cheek. Nevertheless, it would be better to use a clearer descriptor than “law” for these that don’t always hold - and shouldn’t be presented as such, like [principle](https://sciencing.com/difference-between-law-and-principle-in-physics-12760897.html) .

Instead of straightforward facts or subjective opinions, I’m the area where guiding principles are mostly true, but specific details aren’t as important. Games can do this well: Kerbal Space program creates a fictional solar system that somewhat resembles our solar system. Although characteristics/properties of their universe diverge from ours, the overall process in experimenting there is still valid.
I wonder if there’s more applications to separation of presentation from underlying data, or using flexible  instead of constant data.
