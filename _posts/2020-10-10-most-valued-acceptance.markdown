When the world, or a given society, isn’t fair or ideal in any given dimension, we can struggle with it - either tangibly or mentally. There can be motivation to change it
 Some ways to improve things are to currently within our influence, others are a function of the many opportunities the developing world will eventually present.

There are lot of bad things that have happened / will continue to happen.
This can spark cynicism/outrage about objectively (or subjectively) bad events and actors.  Sometimes, things are going really well, and we want to have a broader impact outside of ourselves. Another reason we might be upset is if something else is not ideal in our life - let’s find something way worse - and now our issue comparatively isn’t as big of a deal. This great world we live in is a package deal. It seems like what i’m trying to strive for is acceptance, but not complacency. Choosing it as motivation or fuel, but not pointless outrage or jaded helplessness. People are going to do stupid/malicious things and the negative externalities can also affect your or other’s lives, marginally or greatly. If you have opportunity and comparative advantage, you can do something about it on your own cadence. At various stages, we can make our lives and/or one of these world problems in some dimension slightly better. We don't have to do it all at once. And that’s ok.

<!--  other reasons people try to imporve things - when going well-->
<!-- even if we improved everything (maximally/beyond), there will continue to be bad things -->
