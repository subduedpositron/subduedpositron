A Minor hamstring injury
A few months ago (Dec 2020), i was doing a routine leg exercise (single-leg leg press) when i felt an hamstring pull and stopped immediately. Although i was initially concerned, it was clear even later that day it wasnâ€™t going to be anything serious -  with a few weeks of recovery (being conservative) I was back.

It happened immediately - with zero indication from the previous rep, on the second warmup set, doing perhaps 70% of the (previously done) max weight i was scaling up towards. This seems to indicate this injury was more due to cumulative susceptibility, as opposed to specific overexertion.  How much of it was due to overexertion, vs suboptimal recovery ? While I can't know the answer to that, I want to reduce the probability of it happening again.

Why I do single leg press
    - to improve power/quickness, already have enough strength. so max power/speed over max weight
    - minimize chance of back injury
        - if i to do squats/deadlifts, even two leg press, it seems like a matter of time before i tweak my back
        - reducing back injuries are (an order of magnitude, infinitely) more important than other types of muscular injuries
        - possible concentrating on isolated exercises leads body to more susceptible
            
        
Adjustments I'm making
    - significantly reduce  weight + reps for single leg press, keep max intensity at 100%, slightly increase sets
    - include combined (non-isolated) exercises ex. lunges to complement
    - reduce stretching the 24hrs before leg exercises, maintain/increase stretching during other days (including afterwards)
            - as i aggressively stretched the night before the injury. perhaps this is an overcorrection, but i'll take my chances with this approach
