The games that are contrasted at the end of this post fulfill a large amount of these preferences, and these preferences guide which kinds of upcoming games I’d like to play

#### Strong Preferences
*I view these as almost requirements for playing a game. I might try a game that doesn’t fulfill one of these, but won’t go into a deep dive of it. These also are very unlikely to change for me. Roughly ordered.*
- **Real world concepts**. Somewhat realistic in current/near-future, can be surrealistic
- **Asymmetric starting conditions**. Prefer this as a driver of difficulty over difficulty sliders
- Can **experience concepts + strategic decisions in a shallow dive/playthrough** 
- **War doesn't have to be a meaningful aspect**. At least able to play while avoiding it 


#### Medium Preferences
*Considerations I definitely value, but will not necessarily base choosing a game on this.
These do tend to impact my likelihood of replaying it. Roughly ordered*
- **Incomplete Information**
    - Unknown or uncertainty in world/population metrics
    - And/or uncertainty in consequences of potential actions
- **Individually/granularly simulated** instead of aggregate (sub)population simulations
- **Unopinionated** (expand on)
- **Balances of efficiency vs robustness/resiliency**. 
    - Most games value efficiency, which is easier with known conditions. Requiring robustness/resiliency to adverse situations is a fun dynamic to also have to support(?)
Cascading effects resulting in non-linear walkthroughs

<br>

As a result of these preferences, here’s **a set of games I have enjoyed most**
- **Surviving Mars**
    - Storylines - 1 of 12(?) possible options- make for varied endgames
    - Need for robustness to adverse events/natural disasters
- **Crusader Kings 3**
    - High amount of incomplete knowledge
    - large difference/variety in asymmetric starting conditions
    - Able to avoid offensive wars using intrigue strategies (but still have to defend against it)
- **Democracy 4**
    - Appreciate the different time delays of policy implementation
    - The certainty of costs/effect is unrealistic and therefore effective optimal strategies seem easier to figure out on successive playthroughs
    - You can succeed in a variety of playstyles, however the game is opinionated in the sense that each policy always has the same spectrum of effects
    - Love the mechanics of cascading cause and effects from policies (including situations that can get triggered)
- **Frostpunk**
    - Love the balance of requiring robustness to adverse situations that can have cascading effects
    - Challenging moral/tactical decisions
- **Hitman**
    - The only one of these i prefer on console (all others are better on PC for larger input capabilities)
    - Although has violence, more of a puzzle game
    - Large variety of tactics to solve each individual level in multiple ways + styles
    - recommend using the “vision(?)” for perhaps the first few playthroughs to get used to gameplay, then turning it off later for more realistic, challenging, and fun stages
- **Tropico 6**
    - Able to rule with varying levels of authoritarianism/socialism(?)
    - Perhaps a little too much micromanagement
