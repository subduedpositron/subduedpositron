When the world isn’t just in any given dimension, we can struggle with it - either tangibly or mentally. There can be motivation to change it, but also this can turn into cynicism/outrage about clearly objective (as well as subjective) bad events and actors - whether from the world or humans.  Another reason we might be upset is if something else is not ideal in our life - let’s find something way worse - and now our issue comparatively isn’t as big of a deal. I think there’s a lot that can be done to fix them - but also realize you can’t fix everything at once. And that’s ok. There are, and always will be bad actors in the world. 

There are a lot of good things I can personally do to further your objectives in any of these directions. Some within my control, some (maybe overlapping) which are a function of the many opportunities the developing world presents. There are also a lot of bad things that have happened and continued to happen. This great world we live in is a package deal. It seems like what i’m trying to strive for is acceptance, but not complacency. Choosing it as motivation or fuel, but not pointless outrage or jaded helplessness.

People are gonna do stupid/malicious things and the negative externalities can also affect your or other’s lives, marginally or greatly. If you have power and comparative advantage, you can do something about it on your own cadence. At each stage, we can make our lives in some dimension and/or one of these world problems slightly better. Don’t do it all at once. And that’s ok.
