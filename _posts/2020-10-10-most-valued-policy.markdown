Is climate change. There are many (economic, social) policies we can have a debate about. But climate change is (one of,a,the) policy that is inarguable. Although the timeline for various steps can be debated, It’s clear imminent, drastic change needs to happen now. And for whatever does ultimately need to happen: it’s far better to err to have an overcorrection (inefficient) vs an undercorrection,(catastrophic). It’s the most important long-term problem that needs immediate steps.  Caring about immediate action on climate change also seems like a proxy for a good mindset on other issues as well.

There’s a question of how much you value the well-being of A) current lives now/short-term, B) current lives in the long-term future, and C) future lives.  Climate change perhaps doesn’t significantly do anything for A. But will have an effect on B and C. Even if you discount the values of B and C relative to A, the size of B and C is so much bigger than A. 

I believe if we don’t significantly improve climate change, then long-term it simply doesn’t matter what our other policies are (given they remain in the Overton window).  The downsides of climate change will overtake, and snowball much greater than the effect of all other policies.
Now there’s a lot of practical considerations / societal mechanics involved, more than simply saying improve the climate. If one group (company, nation, etc) aims to improve their climate effect independently and others do not change (or get worse), there
