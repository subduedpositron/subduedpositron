**Note: this is a negative vibes topic and very underdeveloped post (some logical gaps, talks about a problem without solutions).**


I feel conflicted about crime media. It’s an entertaining topic I really enjoy, whether reading longform articles or watching shows on.

There are various forms, which can be informative /sensationalistic, {true/made up/based on a true story}. 
I’m going to ignore fictional media ex. Movies.

It’s straightforward

Instead I’m going to focus on the role of true crime media ex. but not limited to documentaries, investigative reports, news reports. (i’m a little conflicted on whether to discuss sensationalized news reports with this, or separately. For now, all together).

I’m trying to think about how to reconcile(?) the following:
- The overwhelmingly vast majority of people can watch true crime, and they will not commit (or have any inclination to commit) a crime during their life
- There is a sense of duty to report the truth. And if one group doesn’t, another will - and seize the opportunity
There is an incentive .
- ( i’m missing a few logical steps here)
- The USA, for all of its beneficial attributes - as some characteristics which are huge outliers.
The US has had 57 times as many school shootings as the other major industrialized nations combined


Does that mean we prohibit true crime media ? Of course not. But it seems clear that it generates negative externalities. A lot of societal policies classically deal with negative externalities in other fields (pollution, traffic affecting transportation time, building permits(?)).
Yet true crime media is unrestricted. I don’t have any ideas/solutions for this yet.

There’s also the less tangible, but real + subtle effect on how it changes our society’s perception of reality (link ex. america has less crime, but we think it has more)

(talk about the recognition criminals can get through media, vs the preferred method of ignorning them / refusing to name them and instead acknowledge those adversely  affected)
