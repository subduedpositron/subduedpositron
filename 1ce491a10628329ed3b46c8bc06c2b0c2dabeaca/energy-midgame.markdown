**Daily energy levels**
How and why does my energy level fluctuate during the day?
There’s a natural energy cycle, which is (universally) affected by (physical/mental exertion / stresses/ dietary
/substances / emotional factors), and the question is how - and how well am i able to effectively discern from these
factors when i’m being honest.

In general, my energy level ramps up, peaks midday (mid-morning, and mid-afternoon). The most inevitable lull is in the
evening, with other possible lulls

In the morning - it’s pretty simple. My energy level is related to:
    - the quality of sleep i get,
    - any stressors/(excitors?) that I have in mind at the start of the day.
So it’s fairly easy to discern how much of these

The evening can have slightly more factors, but still can be understood
    - I should have sufficiently exhausted myself physically and/or mentally to be able to go to sleep
    - Getting my mind away from any anxieties that can both keep me up (at low energy)
    - Recent caffeine/alcohol/food consumption


I find the middle of the day is the most challenging, even if I truly am trying.
Not that I am always low energy (i could have high energy), it’s that there’s more uncertainty here
Am I actually mentally tired, or do i have (temporary decision fatigue)? Will a short rest/break be useful, or is it
better to keep pushing myself (at potentially diminishing returns?)
This is certainly influenced as i tend to have a more flexible vs. regimented schedule

It’s natural, perhaps inevitable, that early-game and end-game phases are more well defined
than mid-games.


**Chess/Poker**
In chess, the beginning and end games are well defined up to a certain extent; and the mid game (perhaps tautologically)
is when the game is unique - and there are many more complex / interwined factors.

In poker, you can get a long ways for most pre-flop hands by only considering a few factors (which is also helpful for
reducing decision making, to focus on when important decisions emerge).

On river showdowns, there’s more to consider than pre-flop, but there’s less than the mid-game. As you don’t have to
consider upcoming cards/rounds of betting.



I think I’m always trying to get better at the midgame, but perhaps part of it is recognizing when you’ve started
transitioning to the midgame and embracing the (ambiguity).
