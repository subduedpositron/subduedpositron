I’ve found myself falling asleep listening to a set of scattered topics: that end up having some similarities. It took me a little while to figure out why it was this set. They are things all are part of reality (not fiction), yet have zero effect on my life. They’re evergreen topics where there’s no urgency in listening to them
In order:
**Outer Space**- on a timescale that is guaranteed to not affect me, yet its vast scale makes small worries seem less important.

**Rare natural disasters**
    - Ex. A large  spontaneous blizzard, a carbon monoxide buildup in a lake
    - One-offs, i don’t have to think about if it might happen again (instead of  tornados/earthquakes)
    - Having the adversary being nature instead of humans removes most moral dilemmas which would keep me up thinking

**Sports talk** - usually analytical, sometimes speculative. It certainly fits being a bubble of a world to escape into. A downside of this is this topic is it's usually timely; most go out of date quickly '

**Nature** - ex. Ocean, wildlife.  

I’ve had past phases within the last few years of falling asleep listening to white noise, and getting to a point on thinking about nothing (maybe about breathing). I’ve never been one to consistently go to bed effortlessly and quickly (when i’m not exhausted), but these topics help. Notably i have to queue them up for much longer than i expect to fall asleep, to remove anxiety about it ending. I’ll usually listen to them at 0.8x speed as well - so they last longer, and my mind doesn’t have to work to keep up thinking.  After falling asleep in the middle of them -  i can pick them up another night, possibly listening to parts i’ve already heard.
