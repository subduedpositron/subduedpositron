I’d describe myself as a casual player who’s familiar with basic strategy and has looked at parts of, but hasn’t really dove into ex. game theory optimally guided strategies on all streets.

I strongly prefer playing live or online with friends, but I’ve accepted/rationalized playing online under a pseudonym, even when losing, if it can help me improve my game

I like poker for the strategic and emotional challenges
- **Becoming comfortable with incomplete information**
- **asymmetric starting positions**, and adapting your strategy accordingly (a characteristic i also value in video games)
- **Process over results:** being happy with a play with positive expected value, even if it doesn’t win that specific time
    -ex. pre-flop all-in, If i have a higher pair against a lower pair , i’m an ~80%/20% favorite. The times I lose this are a good barometer for my mental state. Usually I’m good with it, because it’s the right play and this will happen. The times I get frustrated - is a reminder I should either reset my mindset, or more likely take a break and come back another day. Similarly for river cards,less concretely -  calls when i have great hands but not the absolute nuts, etc

- **playing polarized hands leads to clearer decisions either way**
    - A9 unsuited isn’t a good hand as it has marginal value when it hits - unclear how to proceed going forward. Does someone have a better A ?
    - Suited connectors (87s) are great because they are polarized: often get you either high equity(another more common term) or air (nothing)
    - While the above are straightforward examples pre-flop, other hands can become polarized after community cards are dealt

- **Buy-in level : Bankroll management**
    - there’s a lot written on bankroll management - which generally goes as : determine your bankroll, and choose stakes where you have 30-50 buy-ins. If you lose, go down stakes/build back up bankroll. If you win, you can take a few shots at higher stakes. Whether going up or down, you always try to maintain ex. > 15/20 buy-ins left
    - I actually don’t have a set bankroll: so instead I take it it a few buy-ins at a time and think: what is the most i am unflinchingly willing to go all-in if i believe it’s the right play, and comfortably buy back in for the times it doesn’t work out.  This means the monetary outcome is important to me, but it doesn’t skew my decision making.
